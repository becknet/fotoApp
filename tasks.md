# User Dashboard Implementation - Tasks

## Completed Implementation Steps

### 1. ✅ Add Dashboard Route
- **File:** `public/index.php`
- **Change:** Added route `$router->get('/dashboard', 'App\\Controllers\\PhotoController@dashboard');`
- **Location:** Line 50, between change-password and upload routes

### 2. ✅ Create Dashboard Method in PhotoController
- **File:** `app/Controllers/PhotoController.php`
- **Method:** `dashboard()`
- **Features:**
  - Authentication check (redirects to login if not authenticated)
  - Pagination support (20 photos per page)
  - Uses existing `getPhotosByUser()` and `getUserPhotoCount()` methods
  - Passes data to dashboard view

### 3. ✅ Create Dashboard View
- **File:** `app/Views/photos/dashboard.php`
- **Features:**
  - Displays total photo count
  - Grid layout with photo thumbnails
  - Quick edit/delete buttons on each photo card
  - Delete confirmation dialog
  - Pagination navigation
  - Upload button for new photos
  - Empty state message for users with no photos

### 4. ✅ Update Navigation
- **File:** `app/Views/layout.php`
- **Change:** Added "My Photos" link in navigation menu
- **Visibility:** Only shown to authenticated users

## Key Features Implemented

### User Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- **Authentication Required:** Users must be logged in to access
- **Photo Grid:** Displays user's photos in responsive grid layout
- **Photo Statistics:** Shows total number of uploaded photos
- **Quick Actions:** Edit and delete buttons directly on each photo card
- **Pagination:** Supports multiple pages for users with many photos
- **Responsive Design:** Uses existing Bootstrap theme for consistency

### Security Considerations
- ✅ Authentication check prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ CSRF protection on delete forms
- ✅ Delete confirmation prevents accidental deletions
- ✅ Uses existing authorization patterns (owner-only edits/deletes)
- ✅ All output properly escaped with `\App\View::escape()`

### UI/UX Features
- **Empty State:** Friendly message and upload button for new users
- **Photo Preview:** Thumbnail images with hover effects
- **Action Buttons:** Clear edit/delete options
- **Upload Integration:** Quick access to upload new photos
- **Navigation:** Easy access via "My Photos" menu item
